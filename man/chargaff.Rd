\title{Base composition in ssDNA for 7 bacterial DNA}
\description{
Long before the genomic era, it was possible to get some data
for the global composition of single-stranded DNA chromosomes
by direct chemical analyses. These data are from Chargaff's lab
and give the base composition of the L (Ligth) strand for
7 bacterial chromosomes.
}
\usage{data(chargaff)}
\format{
  A data frame with 7 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{[A]}{frequencies of A bases in percent}
    \item{[G]}{frequencies of G bases in percent}
    \item{[C]}{frequencies of C bases in percent}
    \item{[T]}{frequencies of T bases in percent}
  }

\details{
Data are from Table 2 in Rudner \emph{et al.} (1969) for the
L-strand. Data for \emph{Bacillus subtilis} were taken from
a previous paper: Rudner \emph{et al.} (1968). This is in
fact the average value observed for two different strains
of \emph{B. subtilis}: strain W23 and strain Mu8u5u16.\cr
Denaturated chromosomes can be separated by a technique of
intermitent gradient elution from a column of methylated
albumin kieselguhr (MAK), into two fractions, designated,
by virtue of their buoyant densities, as L (light) and H
(heavy). The fractions can be hydrolyzed and subjected to
chromatography to determined their global base composition.\cr
The surprising result is that we have almost exactly A=T
and C=G in single stranded-DNAs. The second paragraph page
157 in Rudner \emph{et al.} (1969) says: "Our previous
work on the complementary strands of \emph{B. subtilis} DNA
suggested an additional, entirely unexpected regularity,
namely, the equality in either strand of 6-amino and 6-keto
nucleotides ( A + C = G + T). This relationship, which
would normally have been regarded merely as the consequence
of base-pairing in DNA duplex and would not have been predicted
as a likely property of a single strand, is shown here to
apply to all strand specimens isolated from denaturated DNA
of the AT type (Table 2, preps. 1-4). It cannot yet be said
to be established for the DNA specimens from the equimolar
and GC types (nos. 5-7)."

Note that \code{example(chargaff)} gives more details:
the red areas correspond to non-allowed values beause the sum
of the four bases frequencies cannot exceed 100\%.
The white areas correspond to possible values (more exactly
to the projection from \code{R^4} to the corresponding \code{R^2} planes
of the region of allowed values).
The blue lines correspond to the very small subset of allowed
values for which we have in addition PR2 state, that is
\code{[A]=[T]} and \code{[C]=[G]}. Remember, these data are for ssDNA!
