\title{Consensus and profiles for sequence alignments}
\description{
  This function returns a consensus using variuous methods (see details)
  or a profile from a sequence alignment.
}
\usage{
consensus(matali, method = c( "majority", "threshold", "IUPAC", "profile"), 
  threshold = 0.60, warn.non.IUPAC = FALSE, type = c("DNA", "RNA"))
con(matali, method = c( "majority", "threshold", "IUPAC", "profile"), 
  threshold = 0.60, warn.non.IUPAC = FALSE, type = c("DNA", "RNA"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{matali}{an object of class \code{alignment} as returned by 
    \code{\link{read.alignment}}, or a matrix of characters.}
  \item{method}{select the method to use, see details.}
  \item{threshold}{for the \code{threshold} method, a numeric value beteen 0 and 1
    indicating the minimum relative frequency for a character to be returned
    as the consensus character. If none, NA is returned.}
  \item{warn.non.IUPAC}{for the \code{IUPAC} method this argument is passed 
   to \code{\link{bma}} with a default value set to FALSE to avoid warnings due 
   to gap characters in the alignment.}
  \item{type}{for the \code{IUPAC} method this argument is passed 
   to \code{\link{bma}}.}
}
\details{

  \item{"majority"}{The character with the higher frequency is returned as the
  consensus character.}

  \item{"threshold"}{As above but in addition the character relative frequency
  must be higher than the value controled by the \code{threshold} argument.
  If none, NA id returned.}

  \item{"IUPAC"}{Make sense only for nucleic acid sequences (DNA or RNA).
  The consensus character is defined if possible by an IUPAC symbol by
  function \code{\link{bma}}. If this is not possible, when there is a gap
  character for instance, NA is returned.}

  \item{"profile"}{With this method a matrix with the count of each possible
  character at each position is returned.}

\code{con} is a short form for \code{consensus}.

}
\value{
  Either a vector of single characters with possible NA or a matrix with
  the method \code{profile}.

#
# Read 5 aligned DNA sequences at 42 sites:
#
  phylip <- read.alignment(file = system.file("sequences/test.phylip",

# Show data in a matrix form:
#

# With the majority rule:

#
# With a threshold:
#
  res.thr <- consensus(phylip, method = "threshold")
  res.thr[is.na(res.thr)] <- "." # change NA into dots
  stopifnot(c2s(res.thr) == "aa.c..t.gc.gtt..g..t.a.cc..ggccg.......ta.")
