\title{GC content and aerobiosis in bacteria}
\description{
  This data set was used in Naya \emph{et al.} (2002) to study the relationship between the genomic G+C content of bacteria and whether they are (stricly) aerobes or anaerobes.

Data imported into seqinr by J.R. Lobry on 09-OCT-2016. Original source location given in the article was \code{http://oeg.fcien.edu.uy/GCprok/} but is no more active. Data were copied at \url{http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/R/donnees/gcO2.txt} (\emph{cf.} section 2.1 in Lobry, J.R (2004) Life history traits and genome structure: aerobiosis and G+C content in bacteria. \emph{Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences}, \bold{3039}:679-686). Import was from this last ressource. There are 130 aerobic genera in this data set while fig. 1 in Naya \emph{et al.} (2002) gives 126. There is no way to track down the reason for this difference because the original data set was lost (HÃ©ctor Musto pers. comm.). The number of anaerobic genera (n = 69) is consistent between the present data set and fig. 1 in Naya \emph{et al.} (2002).
